// MARK: - 2B-3 C12b-2: the AppModel ↔ C12 coordinator seam
//
// Splits a boot into two phases with EXPLICIT thread boundaries:
//  - Phase A (`resolveOutcome`): the heavy coordinator chain (integrity check, whole-DB copy,
//    hashing). It MUST run OFF the main actor and returns ONLY a value-typed `BootOutcome` —
//    never a `LedgerStore`. The production runner dispatches it to a detached background task
//    (not merely an `async` declaration), so the off-main boundary is real and testable.
//  - Phase B (`attempt`): `@MainActor`, synchronous. Delegates to `MigrationBootDriver.attemptOpen`
//    so confirm→open stay adjacent with no suspension, and the LedgerStore is created on the
//    main actor. `SQLiteDatabase` is not thread-safe, so the store is never built off-main.
//
// Everything here is INTERNAL — no public App API is added for testing.

/// One boot request variant. `Equatable` so tests can assert the exact intent handed to Phase A.
